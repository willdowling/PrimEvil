# PrimeEvil

Welcome to **PrimeEvil**, an engaging simulation game that puts you in the shoes of a new employee at an Amazon warehouse. Your primary responsibility is sorting packages, and your earnings are determined by commission. The money you earn is crucial for covering life's essentials.

## Gameplay Overview

The goal of the game is to navigate the challenges of a typical workweek in the warehouse. Successfully completing the week grants you a furlough and some well-deserved rest. However, there are potential pitfalls, such as failing to earn enough money for food or rent, leading to eviction or hunger.

The company's main focus is profit, emphasizing the adage that time is money. Workers face fines for mistakes on the production line and are expected to take even bathroom breaks at their workstations. Adding to the stress, a co-worker falls ill, doubling your workload and pressure as you must decide whether to help them or take over their tasks.

Once your shift is over, it's time to return home. With the money earned at the warehouse, you must pay your rent and purchase basic items such as food.

## Motivation Behind the Game

I was drawn to developing a project like this to highlight Amazon's poor treatment of their workforce and generally bad in-house practices. From deceptive terms like 'fulfillment centers' for what amounts to a brutal production line to employees being afraid to take bathroom breaks, the game sheds light on these issues.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon risked their workers' health to fulfill orders, as exemplified by German warehouse workers striking due to poor health provisions [source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=&cad=rja&ua...). Instances of Amazon punishing employees who speak out against labor practices are also highlighted [source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/17/amazon-worker-claims-company-wrote-her-up-for-to...).

Taking inspiration from Lucas Pope's game "Papers Please" and its exploration of immigration and foreign policies, PrimeEvil aims to make players question their morality in certain situations. The monotony of tasks in both games reflects the repetitive and challenging reality fufilment center employees experience in the real world.

## Reflection and Aspirations

PrimeEvil illustrates how pressurized and stressful working in such an environment can be. The game aims to showcase the amount of repetitive, physical labor needed to provide for the most basic items necessary for survival.

Aspirations for the game include implementing more events and dialogue to further illustrate workplace difficulties. For example, pay deductions for being late or time off for medical treatment could be explored. Developing a realistic pricing structure for pay and actual prices of food items and basic necessities is also in consideration. Additionally, creating more true-to-life outcomes for worker actions, such as breakages and mistakes, would provide players with a greater sense of the reality of working in this environment.
